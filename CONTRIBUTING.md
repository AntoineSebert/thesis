## How to contribute

Please note we have a [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

### Did you find a bug ?

* **Do not open up a GitHub issue if the bug is a security vulnerability**, and instead to refer to our [Security Policy](SECURITY.md).

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](issues/new) using the template. Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### Did you write a patch that fixes a bug ?

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch following the template.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

### Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one ?

* Suggest your change to antoine.sb@orange.fr and start writing code.

* Do not open an issue on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback about the change. GitHub issues are primarily intended for bug reports and fixes.

### Start reading the code and you'll get the hang of it. We optimize for readability:

  * I indent using tabs
  * I always put spaces after list items and method parameters (`[1, 2, 3]`, not `[1,2,3]`), around operators (`x += 1`, not `x+=1`), and around hash arrows.
  * This is open source software. Consider the people who will read your code, and make it look nice for them. It's sort of like driving a car: Perhaps you love doing donuts when you're alone, but with passengers the goal is to make the ride as smooth as possible.

### Do you have questions about the source code?

* Ask any question about the project antoine.sb@orange.fr.

Thanks! :heart:
